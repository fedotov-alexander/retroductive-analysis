# Retroductive Analysis
Retroductive analysis of longitudinal data is based on a simple idea:
if we have a set of chains of events associated with the same entity
or object with a variable lifespan we can choose the most enduring survivalists
first and use them as the top branches of the 'tree of life' comprised
of the 'life stories' of a population of these entities. Then we
can step by step descend to the levels of the previous 'forks' and analyze what
happened to the survivalists who didn't make it to the main trunk, how
did their 'life' end on each of the branches.

The main goal of this analysis is to produce enough 'decision-tree-like'
examples for an Abstract Intelligence to reason about. Not only the
examples must be statistically 'representative' of certain scenarios,
they must be 'explainable' and 'understandable' in order to provide a
meaningful text, associated with a particular example of longevity. In order to
achieve that we need to give a plausible explanation (hypothesis) not
only for the particular 'branches' of the 'forks' on lower levels, but
for the further 'forks' of those 'branches' etc. etc. Basically, 
for the Abstract Intelligence to be able to reason about the factors
defining longevity and to predict the potential longevity of a particular
survivalist we need to provide it with sufficient number of _explained_ (at least hypothetically)
'life stories' (longitudinal data) with unified descriptions of all the 'forks'.

This 'tree of life' description of the game of survival clearly has a multi-scale
property, - forks can be described by probability distributions for each
of the branches as a whole which is a superposition of all distributions of
the further sub-branches.
