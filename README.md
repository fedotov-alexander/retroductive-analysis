# Retroductive Analysis
Retroductive analysis of longitudinal data is based on a simple idea:
if we have a set of chains of events associated with the same entity
or object with a variable lifespan we can choose the longest survivalists
first and use them as the top branches of the 'tree of life'. Then we
can descend to the levels of the preceding 'crotches' and analyze what
happened to the survivalists who didn't make it to the main trunk, how
did their 'life' end.

The main goal of this analysis is to produce enough 'decision-tree-like'
examples for an Abstract Intelligence to reason about.
